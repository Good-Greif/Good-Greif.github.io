      <h2>About Me/Skillz</h2>
      <p><br>As an experienced videographer, photographer, and avid artist, I have a broad range of skills and capabilities, including creating and capturing anything from advertisements, styling, portraits, weddings, music videos, to short films. With 6 years of experience in creating professional work, I have worked for ESPN+ and full-length feature films, including one starring Tom Green.<br><br>

I am always seeking new knowledge and opportunities for growth. I was even awarded a scholarship to study Chinese in Taiwan, where I became HSK 3   conversational in Mandarin. In addition to my language skills, I am fluent in all  of the the typical Adobe Suite programs, Final Cut, and DaVinci, and hold a FAA 107 drone certification.<br><br>

In pursuit of my passion, I earned a BS in Television and Film, completing my four-year degree in just three years. I am always learning new trends and keeping up with technology to deliver high-quality results. And not just creative skills, but I even managed to learn many technical skills, I even coded and published the website you're on right now.</p><br>

        <h2>The Tripp Travelers</h2>
        <br><p>(Check out the ending at 6:40) My first wedding video was an incredible experience that allowed me to showcase my skills as a videographer. I approached the wedding with a deep commitment to capturing the essence of the couple's love story in a unique and unforgettable way. Despite being early in my career, I was confident in my abilities and my ability to deliver a high-quality product. <br>

Throughout the day, I worked tirelessly to capture every special moment and to highlight the unique beauty of the event. I used my artistic eye and technical expertise to capture the lighting, angles, and perspectives that best showcased the couple and their surroundings. My editing skills allowed me to take the raw footage and transform it into a beautiful, cinematic story that captured the heart of the event.<br>

Looking back on that early work, I am proud of how far I have come as a videographer. I have continued to refine my skills and to push the boundaries of what is possible in wedding videography. However, even with all the experience and knowledge that I have gained, I remain confident that my early work was truly exceptional and set the stage for the incredible videos that I continue to produce today.</p>

        <h2>Must Have Macarons N' More</h2>
        <p>Firstly, I started by researching the woman and her business. I wanted to understand her story, how she got started in baking, and what makes her business unique. I also wanted to get a sense of her personality and how she interacts with her customers. This research helped me plan out the video and determine what kind of shots I would need to capture. <br>

Once I had a plan in place, I scheduled a day to film at her bakery. I arrived early to set up my equipment and make sure everything was ready to go. I then spent several hours filming her baking, interacting with customers, and sharing her story with me. I also took footage of the bakery itself, including shots of the delicious treats on display and the cozy atmosphere of the space. <br>

After I finished filming, I went back to my editing suite and began piecing together the footage. I wanted to tell a story that captured the woman's love for baking, her journey to success, and the impact her business has on the local community. I carefully selected the best shots and edited them together to create a cohesive and engaging video.
        Overall, it was a fun and rewarding experience creating this video. I loved being able to showcase this woman's talent and passion, and I hope the video helps to promote her business and inspire others to pursue their dreams.</p>
